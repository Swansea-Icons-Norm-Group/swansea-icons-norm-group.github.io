Today we had the pleasure of presenting our work at a [MASI](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/masi/) showcase event! Here we had the oppurtunity to discuss some of the results from our normative studies of investigating how people from different cultures and backgrounds understand icons on 7 different criteria.
