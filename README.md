# Swansea Icons Norm Group (SING)

This is the repository for creating the public group website. It is written using the jekyll web system.

If everything is installed, you can run serve this website locally with:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The output messages of this command should display the IP (usually localhost) and the port the website is running on. Opening this location in the web-browser, you should see the website.
